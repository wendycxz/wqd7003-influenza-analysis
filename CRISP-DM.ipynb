    "<h2>Problem statement<h2>\n",
    "<h4>Influenza outbreaks can have a significant impact on public health and the economy. Early detection and response are critical to minimizing the spread of the virus. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict influenza outbreaks, providing public health officials, healthcare providers, and policymakers with timely and accurate predictions of where and when outbreaks are likely to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>The project aims to address the following challenges:<h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>The unpredictability of influenza outbreaks, which can make it difficult for public health officials to respond in a timely and effective manner.\n",
    "<li>The complexity of the factors that contribute to the spread of the virus, which can make it challenging to identify the most important variables for prediction.\n",
    "<li>The lack of real-time data on influenza outbreaks, which can limit the ability of stakeholders to take timely action.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will focus on analyzing historical data on influenza outbreaks, weather patterns, vaccination rates, and social media activity to identify patterns and trends that can help predict the likelihood of an outbreak. The success criteria for the project will be based on the accuracy and timeliness of the predictions, as well as the ability of stakeholders to take action based on the predictions.<h4>"

    "<h2>Data Understanding<h2>\n",
    "<h4>The datasets used in this project come from two sources: the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and the California Health and Human Services (CHHS). The datasets provide information on influenza outbreaks in California from 2010 to 2021, including weekly counts of reported cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>The CDPH dataset contains weekly counts of reported influenza cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for each county in California. The data is reported by age group, gender, and influenza subtype. The CHHS dataset provides additional information on influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in California, including data on laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, ILI emergency department visits, and ILI hospitalizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>The datasets also include additional variables that may be relevant for predicting influenza outbreaks, such as weather data, vaccination rates, and social media activity. The weather data includes information on temperature, humidity, and precipitation, while the vaccination rates provide information on the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated against the flu. The social media data includes information on how people are talking about the flu on social media platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>The datasets contain a large amount of missing data, particularly for the social media variables. The project team will need to carefully consider how to handle missing data and how it may affect the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>The datasets will be cleaned and preprocessed to prepare them for analysis in the Data Preparation stage. This will involve removing duplicates and missing data, transforming variables as necessary, and merging the datasets into a single data set for modeling. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques will be used to understand the distributions and relationships among the variables and identify potential outliers and anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>The project team will also need to consider how to handle seasonality in the data, as influenza outbreaks tend to occur during the winter months. Time series analysis techniques may be used to account for seasonality and other time-dependent patterns in the data."
