    "<h2>Problem statement<h2>\n",
    "<h4>Influenza outbreaks can have a significant impact on public health and the economy. Early detection and response are critical to minimizing the spread of the virus. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict influenza outbreaks, providing public health officials, healthcare providers, and policymakers with timely and accurate predictions of where and when outbreaks are likely to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>The project aims to address the following challenges:<h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>The unpredictability of influenza outbreaks, which can make it difficult for public health officials to respond in a timely and effective manner.\n",
    "<li>The complexity of the factors that contribute to the spread of the virus, which can make it challenging to identify the most important variables for prediction.\n",
    "<li>The lack of real-time data on influenza outbreaks, which can limit the ability of stakeholders to take timely action.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will focus on analyzing historical data on influenza outbreaks, weather patterns, vaccination rates, and social media activity to identify patterns and trends that can help predict the likelihood of an outbreak. The success criteria for the project will be based on the accuracy and timeliness of the predictions, as well as the ability of stakeholders to take action based on the predictions.<h4>"
